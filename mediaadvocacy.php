              <h3><font color="blue">Media Mapping Analysis for FP2020</font></h3>
              <p>The FP2020 global partnership is an outcome of the 2012 London Summit on Family Planning, where more than 20
                governments made a commitment to make affordable, lifesaving contraceptives, information, services and supplies
                available to 120 million women and girls in 69 of the world’s poorest countries by 2020. The movement now
                has over 80 commitments from governments, NGOs and other bodies. </p>

                <p>The importance of mapping of media need not be over emphasized in any developmental endeavors. As media and
                  communications components are vital component of sharing and strengthening demand for sound, equitable
                  and accountable family planning, and building a body of evidence of that have contributed well in the development
                  process. Effective communications are critical to engage with various stakeholders and audiences, providing
                  accurate, relevant and timely information through a range of channels about the objectives of the programme,
                  its activities, milestones and successes, and sharing lessons learnt. National platforms and CSOs needs
                  to be supported to deliver the media and communications plans developed in the inception phase of FP2020
                  with strategic support for a portfolio of creative media and communications interventions that are linked
                  directly to key strategy focus areas. Therefore, a media mapping analysis based on media analysis toolkit
                  was planned to carry out for the inception phase of FP2020 with an aim to help draft media plans at the
                  implementation phase of the project.</p>
                <p>The mapping team assessed the structure of media in Nepal, media consumption, geographical coverage and languages
                  including the coverage of key issues. It critically examined and reviewed various policy as regards to
                  how it is communicated to its audiences, how it has been implemented by media houses and understanding
                  of media reporter. The team attempted to identify key issues being reported about the FP 2020 commitments
                  by the government and how this is being reported by media. The report is based on the access of communication
                  means throughout the country. </p>
                <p>Access of household facilities of communication means, according to National Population and Household Census
                  Report 2011, is as follows:</p>

              <h3><font color="blue">Analyzing the National Media Safety Landscape for Journalists</font></h3>

              <p>The safety of journalists is considered an important human rights issue in itself. Moreover, it is considered
                central to the realization of freedom of expression in broader context. The issue of journalists’ safety
                is critical to their being active agents in social and public life for the promotion of freedom of expression.
                If journalists cannot exercise the freedom of expression in safety, any provision that guarantees such freedom
                is of little value. In fact, ensuring journalists' safety is one of the significant aspects of vibrant democracy.

                <p>s the United Nations specialized agency with a mandate to 'promote the free flow of ideas by word and image',
                  the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has been an important player
                  in the promotion of the safety of journalists and the fight against impunity. Over the years, it has been
                  monitoring the safety of journalists and state of impunity, and has published reports about this on a regular
                  basis. It has put the focus on the issue of journalists’ safety through various declarations, resolutions,
                  reports, and activities. </p>
                <p>This final report presents an assessment of the national media safety landscape for journalists in Nepal.
                  The study has employed the Journalists' Safety Indicators endorsed by the UN Plan of Action on the Safety
                  of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity. </p>

                <p>Employing the Journalists' Safety Indicators (JSI) endorsed by the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists
                  and the Issue of Impunity, a study has been conducted for an assessment of the national media safety landscape
                  for journalists in Nepal. Based on the assessment, a set of key-recommendations for each of the key indicator
                  categories of the JSI has been presented in addition to the report. </p>
                <p>Though there is a huge growth in terms of quantity in the media sector journalism remains professionally
                  weak and economically insecure, and the journalists are in highly vulnerable condition in terms of physical
                  and psychological safety. Nearly half of the journalists do not have any appointment letter/contract from
                  their employers, and journalism profession in Nepal is characterized by low wages, irregular payments,
                  poor working conditions, and declining credibility among the public. Journalists perceive that they are
                  prone to be victimized by both State and non-State actors, and the prolonged political transition has further
                  complicated their security situation.
                </p>
                <p>The status of women journalists is even more complicated. They are more vulnerable than their male colleagues
                  in terms of professional as well as psychological and physical safety. It is widely acknowledged that women
                  journalists have been facing various problems including exclusion, glass ceiling, gender pay gap, and harassment,
                  and they are more vulnerable than their male counterparts. They are particularly at risk from sexual harassment
                  even within media organisations, and there is a culture of impunity around sexual harassment.</p>
                <p>Impunity has been very serious concern of the stakeholders addressing journalists’ safety in Nepal. Some
                  media rights activists even fear of systematic impunity. As prompt, independent and efficient investigations
                  of crime against journalists have not been ensured, and prosecutions for violence and intimidation have
                  not been carried out against full chain of actors in violence and threats against journalists, the faith
                  on State agencies including the criminal and civil justice system is diminishing. Prevailing impunity in
                  Nepal poses serious concern with regard to freedom of expression and press freedom as journalists are practising
                  self-censorship due to impunity.</p>
                <p>The project was facilitated by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
                  which was formally completed on 28th July 2015.

              <p>Global Environment Facility's – Small Grants Programme (GEF-SGP) was initiated by UNDP since 1992 in Nepal.
                Since then, more than 100 projects have been implemented in the area of biodiversity, climate change, land
                degradation and capacity building sectors to bring notable changes in livelihood of common people. </p>

                <p>People from different parts of the country were keenly interested to participate in this kind of public hearing
                  and interaction programs. The production team realized that there were many issues related to biodiversity,
                  climate change mitigation and land degradation. The program was able to find out about the improvement
                  in livelihood of local people, income generation and positive impacts by the preservation and conservation
                  of nature. </p>

                <p>Based on the achievements, successes and lesson learned from the projects implemented, Development Communication
                  Society Nepal (SODEC-Nepal) carried out production and broadcasting of the media activities which includes
                  video documentary, project based field report, studio based TV talk shows and public hearing. All of these
                  activities were based on diverse dynamics of the projects that are funded by SGP and implemented by different
                  community based organizations (CBOs) and non- governmental organizations (NGOs). </p>
                <p>The program has covered major areas of Nepal which included districts like Chitwan, Dang, Kathmandu, Kailali,
                  Kapilbastu, Lalitpur, Makwanpur and Syangja. Different concerned people and indigenous people related to
                  the subject were focused in the program. Participants of the program included both male and female. The
                  program was useful in highlighting the issues such as bio-diversity, climate change mitigation and land
                  degradation around the country. The qualitative and quantitative research was carried out during this process.
                  The issue covered in the program is important because it highlighted the achievements of local people.
                  Television programme production team closely consulted with SGP Nepal Office, implementing agencies and
                  local communities i.e. beneficiaries. We tried to maximize the participation of various people in the TV
                  programmes through vox-pops, bytes and interviews. We were careful to make the participation inclusive
                  from gender, ethnicity and other perspective. </p>

              <p>There has been significant qualitative and quantitative development of journalism studies in Nepal since its
                inception by Tribhuvan University on 1976. Gradually but eventually Kathmandu University and Purvanchal University
                followed suit, further enriching the advancement of journalism academia. However, there have been criticisms
                that the journalism curricula have been building a huge gap between the classroom instructions and newsroom
                requirements. </p>
